Simple image gallery sharing application. Galleries are creatable by everyone
and available with a token in the URL. Everyone with the correct URL can change
the gallery name, upload images and set their title. On creation, a boss token
is generated, which can be used to delete the whole gallery, single pictures or
make the gallery read-only later on.

You can test this at https://imgshr.space!

## Features

* Galleries are shared via secret token in URL
  (e.g. [https://imgshr.space/!Njg4NThi](https://imgshr.space/!Njg4NThi))
* Galleries are editable by everyone or -- when they are configured to be
  read-only -- only with a boss token (URL)
* Pictures can be shared with token URLs to prevent giving away a gallery's
  token
* EXIF data is read and shown
* Pictures can be rated
* Infinite scrolling on gallery page
* Lazy image loading
* Responsive design
* Tagging of images
* Filter by tags, date, rating
* Automatic labelling using self-hosted Convolutional Neural Network
  (Inception v3 model)
* GitHub login for taking track of galleries and gallery administration
* Device token authentication for galleries
* Symmetric client-side encrypted galleries with sharable secret based on
  libsodium (XSalsa20 for encryption, Poly1305 for authentication)

## Development

    nvm use
	npm install -g yarn
	yarn
	bundle
	foreman start

## Deployment using docker

### Initial setup

Clone the source code:

    git clone https://github.com/nning/imgshr.git
    cd imgshr

Make sure, you generate a Rails secret key and paste it into `.env`. You can
also change other parameters like the MySQL password and the admin login
credentials in `.env` and `config/settings.yml`.

    docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml run web rails secret

Now start up all services:

    docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up

**The docker volumes `deploy_db`, `deploy_redis`, and `deploy_storage` hold the
production data; make sure, you do not lose them.**

### Update the code

    docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml down
    git pull
    docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up --build
