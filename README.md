IMGSHR
======

Simple image gallery sharing application. Galleries are creatable by everyone
and available with a token in the URL. Everyone with the correct URL can change
the gallery name, upload images and set their title. On creation, a boss token
is generated, which can be used to delete the whole gallery, single pictures or
make the gallery read-only later on.
